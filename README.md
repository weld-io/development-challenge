# Weld Development Challenge

So happy youâ€™re interested in working at [Weld](https://www.weld.io)!

## The Task

1. The task is to build a User Admin app using React Hooks.
2. Implement a GUI similar to this prototype: [www.weld.io/namechanger](https://www.weld.io/namechanger)
3. Perform REST requests against the API `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users` (see API below).
4. Try to impress us!
  - Use React Hooks and possibly custom hooks.
  - Preferably use a global state container (e.g. Redux).
  - UX: make the app easy to use.
  - Code style: write and organize your code in a way so someone could continue working on it later.

## Server API

Supported:

    GET /users
